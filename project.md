# Course Project

## Project Overview


I am trying to predict a health system's patient volume across various facilities and imaging modalities.  Being able to predict patient volumes would enable more efficient labor scheduling.  As added background:

* I am planning to use a data set of ~5.5 years of patient volumes (label), segmented by date, facility, imaging modality, and patient type (inpatient, outpatient, emergency department).  
* The dataset is not evenly populated amongst facilities and imaging modalities.  As an example, there are missing days for specific modalities and facilities.  This could be due to facility hours (e.g. closed on certain days) or dirty data.  I will have to research the data further to find out
* I choose this topic because of an interest in healthcare data as well as common exposure to similar time series related questions (e.g. predicting financial measures)

## Future Deliverables: 

### October 26 (Mandatory): First Draft Due

Zip up all files relevant to your project, and email them to Sinan. Your peers and instructors will provide feedback, according to [these guidelines](peer_review.md).

At a minimum, you should include:
* Narrative of what you have done so far and what you are still planning to do, ideally in a format similar to the format of your final project paper
* Code, with lots of comments

Ideally, you would also include:
* Visualizations you have done
* Slides (if you have started making them)
* Data and data dictionary

Tips for success:
* The work should stand "on its own", and should not depend upon the reader remembering anything you might have previously said in class about your project.
* Organize your narrative and files so that the reader can easily follow along.
* The better you explain your project, and the easier it is to follow, the more useful feedback you will receive!
* If your reviewers can actually run your code on the provided data, they will be able to give you more useful feedback on your code. (It can be very hard to make useful code suggestions on code that can't be run!)


### November 18 (Optional): Second Draft Due 

If you would like additional feedback on your project, submit a revised version of your project. Your instructors will provide feedback. (There is no peer review for the second draft.)


### November 31 and December 2: Presentation

Deliver your project presentation in class, and submit all required deliverables (paper, slides, code, data, and data dictionary).
